# REACTJS-Vite-tailwind-modernPaymentSystem
My practices on frontend side, creating a predefined template using react and tailwind.

## Installation for your own vite+react application

1. Run the following commands. <br>
- npm create vite@latest <b><i>application-name</i></b>
- cd <b><i>application name</i></b>
- npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
- npm install
- npm run dev

2. To simply run the following application
- cd to the parent directory.
- run the following command  <br>
-- npm install <br>
-- npm run dev<br>

The application runs in default port.

## This is practice for my jouney to learn complete a full stack development.
